## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a really interesting challenge. I was able to put a lot of things that I have been learning in to practice. It took me a while to finish this project since I really didn't understand all the things that I had to have in to consideration. At the end I was able to make it work.

Later I decided that I wanted to challenge myself a little bit more by trying to save the info in to the local storage. I haven't been able to achieve that but hopefully in the near future I will.

### Continued development

One of the main things that I want to be able to understand is how to simplify the code. Right now I'm sure I'm not using best practices and would love to understand how other people is approaching this challenge.

### Useful resources

For this challenge I didn't use any resource. That makes me happy since that is giving me the confidence that I'm learning the tools that I need to create this kind of projects.
For the Local storage part I'm using 2 resources:
